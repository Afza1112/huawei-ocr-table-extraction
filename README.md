# 🧠 Huawei Cloud OCR – Table Data Extraction using Python

## 📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Huawei Cloud’s Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** service to **extract tabular data from images** (such as receipts, invoices, or forms) and convert them into structured, machine-readable data using **Python**.

It was developed as part of my practical work in **AI and Data Science**, focusing on real-world applications of cloud-based computer vision APIs.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this notebook is to:
- Recognize **tables** within image-based documents.
- Extract **text content** using Huawei’s OCR API.
- Convert the recognized data into structured **Pandas DataFrames** for further analysis or visualization.
  
## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Huawei Cloud OCR SDK** (`huaweicloudsdkocr`)
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and tabular representation  
- **Matplotlib** – for optional visualization
  
## ⚙️ Installation

Run the following commands to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install huaweicloudsdkocr
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
